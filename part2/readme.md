# EDOM Project, Part 2 - Team Report

In this folder you should add **all** artifacts developed for part 2 of the EDOM project, related to team/group work.

**Note:** If for some reason you need to bypass these guidelines please ask for directions with your teacher and **always** state the exceptions in your commits and issues in bitbucket.

Following there are examples of proposed sections for this part of the report (team part).

## Domain Knowledge Obtained from Analyzing the Applications

## Design of the Metamodel

### Changes of Part 1 Model

![MetaModelv3](../diagrams/metamodel_v3.png)

## Activity 1: Design Concrete Syntax for the DSL

### Graphical DSL 

#### Epsilon/Eugenia
For each metamodel element, the team chose a different graphically representation:

* AccountGroupSpec - for the AccountGroupSpec, we will be using an **blue square** object;

* UserSpec - for the UserSpec, we will be using an **oval yellow** object;
* AccountSpec - for the AccountSpec, we will be using an **oval red** object;
* TransactionSpec - for the TransactionSpec, we will be using a **oval green** object;

* UserAccountAssociation - for the UserAccountAssociation, we will be using a **orange triangle** object;
* AccountTransactionAssociation - for the Rating, we will be using a **purple triangle** object;

* UserAttribute - for the UserAttribute, we will be using a **yellow square** object;
* AccountAttribute - for the AccountAttribute, we will be using a **red square** object;
* TransactionAttribute - for the TransactionAttribute, we will be using a **green square** object;

* AttributeType - for the AttributeType, we will be using a **oval blue** object;

#### MS Tools

#### Textual DSL (JetBrains MPS)
